## Local HPC facilities at UU

::: {.theme-section-small}

- Utrecht Bioinformatics Center (UBC):
  - \>2000 CPUcores, 30 GPUs, 20 TB ram
- Faculty of Science: 
  - 1 small general purpose cluster
  - \>10 specialized clusters
- Faculty of Geosciences:
  - 1 small general purpose cluster
  - a number of servers (GPU, large memory)
- Faculty of humanities
  - AI cluster
- Etc.

:::


## Introduction
::: {.theme-section}

- Large increase in demand for LSC
- No general local facility for all researchers
- At UU, we meet this demand using SURF services:
    - Snellius
    - ResearchCloud (VRE)
    - RCCS contract
    - Local HPC consultancy and support team
:::

## Research Capacity Computing Service
::: {.theme-section}

RCCS gives institutes direct access to SURFs compute facilities:

- Lowering barriers
- Snellius & SURF Research Cloud
- pay-per-use model

:::

## Research Capacity Computing Service
::: {.theme-section}

Costs:

- 1.000 RCCS-credits - 33,14 euro
- ~0,03 euro per CPU hour on Research Cloud
- ~0,025 euro per CPU hour on Snellius
- Access to commercial cloud (varying cost)

:::

## How do we organize access?

![](images/website.png){width=75%}

- Intake with engineer (30 minutes)
- Starting budget of 10.000 credits
- &rarr; Onboarding time ~2 days

## Support

::: {.theme-section}

Support provided by Research Engineers:

- Getting started workshop (SRC)
- Catalog development (SRC)
- Basic user support (Snellius and SRC)
- Weekly walk-in hours
:::

## History
::: {.theme-section}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- RCCS @ UU runs for ~8 years (Kees van Eijden)
- From ~10 projects to >150 projects
    - 1 every 2 months to 5 per week

## What do we learn from this?

::: {.theme-section}
- Large and growing demand for flexible HPC solutions
    - Small-medium (VRE) as well as large (Snellius) scale.
    - Across all faculties.
- RCCS starting budgets help researchers to conduct exploratory studies, often leading to larger projects.

:::

## What do we learn from this?

::: {.theme-section}
Success factors at UU:

- Close cooperation with SURF
- Low-barrier onboarding & support
- Engineering support
  - Reliable and reusable VRE environments
  - Hands-on customization
  - Basic troubleshooting and guidance
- Good relations with faculty support teams

:::

## What do we learn from this?

::: {.theme-section}

Most importantly:

It takes time and effort to help researchers to get started with HPC.

- Support team of engineers, developers, admins
  - since end of 2023: 1 dedicated engineer

:::

## Future challenges

::: {.theme-section}

- Increasingly large projects
- GPU availability
- Billing recurring large users internally
- Ensuring enough user support, development and intake capacity, together with faculties and SURF
